# How to draw fractals tutorial
Author: [Eduardo Correia](https://github.com/edu-correia)

### :clipboard: Description:
Repository detailing how to draw fractals, used for UFMG's subject Discrete Mathematics pratical project.

### :bulb: Idea:
The pratical project will only run in C language, so you can't use this raw Python file.
So, how do we use it then? We will need to convert this Python file to a C file and then compile it to a binary file using Python libraries.

### :shoe: Steps:
- [Install the necessary libraries](steps.md#install-the-necessary-libraries)
- [Write your python code](steps.md#write-your-python-code)
- [Convert your python file](steps.md#convert-your-python-file)
- [Compile it](steps.md#compile-it)
- [Use it on your own project](steps.md#use-it-on-your-own-project)
